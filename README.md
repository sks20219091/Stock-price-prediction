## Stock-price-prediction

-The proposed system evaluates the application of the forecast
system to the real-world scenario and the problems associated with
the accuracy of the total values provided.
-The high accuracy and profitability was achieved when results of all
algorithms are combined and considered all factors affecting the
stock prices.
-This project was designed using Python, Keras , Tensorflow , Linear
Regression and LSTM ,etc.
