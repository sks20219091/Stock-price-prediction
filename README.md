## Stock-price-prediction

- This project aims to predict the stock price since Stock data is non-stationary, chaotic, random and
depends on several technical parameters.
- Datasets are extracted from Yahoo finance and it predicts prices of the stocks more accurately and
reduces error in prediction using and plot the graph between predicted price and actual price.
- It is implemented using multiple python libraries such as matplotlib, numpy,pandas,etc and built using
LSTM model and deployed using Streamlit .


### Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning Modeling
- Data Scaling up & scaling down using sklearn
- Graph plotting using Matplotlib

### Framework & Libraries used 

-Streamlit
-Tensorflow
-Keras
-numpy
-pandas
-Matplotlib.

### Model Used
