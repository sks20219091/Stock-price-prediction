# Stock-price-prediction

1.The proposed system evaluates the application of the forecast
system to the real-world scenario and the problems associated with
the accuracy of the total values provided.
2.The high accuracy and profitability was achieved when results of all
algorithms are combined and considered all factors affecting the
stock prices.
3.This project was designed using Python, Keras , Tensorflow , Linear
Regression and LSTM ,etc.
